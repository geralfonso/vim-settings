**Setting up the Alex Nussey Dev Enviornment**

TABLE OF CONTENTS:
A) ITERM

------ITERM(A)------

1) Install ITerm. This is an alternative shell client. It is essentially just the Terminal utitlity that comes prepackeaged with OSX, but more asthetically pleasing and with some additional functionality. The shell that is accessed is the same however.

www.iTerm2.com

2) Go to Preferences -> Profiles -> Colors -> Load Presets -> Import and navigate to "Solarized Dark.itermcolors". 

3) Select Load Presets again and choose Solarized Dark from the drop down.

------VS Code (B)-----

Install Visual Studio Code from Microsoft.

Use the GIST ID from ./../README and the "Settings Sync" plugin to restore preferences and other plugins

------ZSHELL(C)------

1) Run the auto installer for oh-my-zsh (an open source zshell management tool). You will be prompted for the admin password along the way

curl -L https://raw.github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh | sh

2) Restart the command line. You are now running zshell

3) Install the SourceCodePro+Powerline+Awesome+Regular.ttf font in the ZSH directory

5) Install the powerline 9k theme
git clone https://github.com/bhilburn/powerlevel9k.git ~/.oh-my-zsh/themes/powerlevel9k

6) Restart the shell session and iTerm. The prompt should now look really nice
6a) You may need to remove the new .zshrc file that was created on ZShell install and replace it with the one that you got from this repo (should have bene auto renamed)

8) Change the font in iTerm2 to be the newly installed font


------VIM(D)------

1) Install Vundle (vim plugin manager) so that we can install packages (bundles). Clone the git repo by calling:

git clone https://github.com/gmarik/vundle.git ~/.vim/bundle/vundle

2) Copy the file .vimrc from the vim directory into the home directory

3) Launch vim (call vim from command line). An error about being unable to find the color scheme solarized will appear. Just ignore this for now and hit enter to skip it.

4) Type :BundleInstall and hit enter to run the Vundle bundle installer. This will download and install several useful packages such as Nerd Tree and the soloarized color scheme. Now type :q and hit enter twice to exit vim

5) Reload vim and you should recieve no error and the colors should be different!
